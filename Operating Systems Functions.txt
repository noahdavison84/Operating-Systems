An awesome function that comes with the MacOS Mojave system is music/video editing apps that come with the computer. 
The apps are completely free and fun to use and come as a default to your computer. 
I infact use Gargage Band and iMovie quite often just becuase of this Operating system.

Another awesome function In MacOS is the Photo Booth. Your able to take photos and put effects on to these photos in real time. You can also tile and distort photos through app. Its a fun and really easy to use application.
